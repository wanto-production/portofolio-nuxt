# Resolving Qt Wayland Symbol Lookup Error After System Update

## The Problem

After updating Arch Linux and Qt packages, I encountered this error when trying to reload my Caelestia shell:

```bash
caelestia shell -d
qs: symbol lookup error: qs: undefined symbol: *ZN15QtWaylandClient17QWaylandShmBufferC1EPNS*15QWaylandDisplayERK5QSize
```

The shell completely failed to start, showing a symbol lookup error related to Qt Wayland components.

## Understanding the Error

This error occurs due to an **ABI (Application Binary Interface) incompatibility**. Here's what happened:

1. **Before update**: Quickshell was compiled against an older version of Qt6 Wayland
2. **After update**: The system now has a newer Qt6 Wayland with a different API signature
3. **The conflict**: The compiled binary expects the old function signature, but the new library has additional parameters

Looking at the symbol names:
- **Expected by quickshell**: `QWaylandShmBufferC1EPNS*15QWaylandDisplayERK5QSize`
- **Available in new Qt6**: `QWaylandShmBufferC1EPNS*15QWaylandDisplayERK5QSizeN6QImage6FormatEdP14wl_event_queue`

The new version added extra parameters (`N6QImage6FormatEdP14wl_event_queue`) to the constructor.

## The Solution

Since `quickshell-git` is an AUR package that was compiled against the old Qt version, we need to rebuild it against the current Qt libraries:

```bash
# Remove the current version
sudo pacman -R quickshell-git

# Rebuild and reinstall from AUR
paru -S quickshell-git --rebuild
```

Or if you're using `yay`:
```bash
yay -S quickshell-git --rebuild
```

## Verification

After rebuilding, verify the fix:

```bash
# Check that quickshell now links against current Qt6 libraries
ldd $(which qs) | grep Qt6Wayland

# Test the shell
caelestia shell -d
```

You should see successful output like:
```
No running instances for "/etc/xdg/quickshell/caelestia/shell.qml"
INFO: Launching config: "/etc/xdg/quickshell/caelestia/shell.qml"
INFO: Shell ID: "..." Path ID "..."
INFO: Configuration Loaded
```

## Prevention Tips

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Rebuild AUR packages after major Qt updates**:
   ```bash
   # Check which AUR packages might need rebuilding
   pacman -Qm | grep -E "(qt|wayland)"
   ```

2. **Use rebuild hooks**: Some AUR helpers can automatically rebuild packages when dependencies update

3. **Monitor Qt private API usage**: Packages using `Qt_*_PRIVATE_API` are more prone to this issue since private APIs can change without notice

## Related Issues

This same pattern can affect other Qt-based AUR packages after system updates. The key indicators are:
- Symbol lookup errors mentioning Qt classes
- Version suffixes like `@@Qt_6_PRIVATE_API`
- Mangled C++ symbol names (starting with `_ZN`)

The solution is always the same: rebuild the affected AUR package against your current Qt installation.

## Conclusion

This ABI incompatibility is a common occurrence when using rolling-release distributions like Arch Linux with AUR packages that depend on rapidly-evolving libraries like Qt. The fix is straightforward - just rebuild the package - but understanding why it happens helps prevent similar issues in the future.
